Title: Easy TV

Description: With so many new TV shows on different channels and platforms, it can be difficult to keep up with new episodes. This program would allow you to pick which shows you want to track (from a large list of providers including Hulu, Netflix, cable, etc..) and creates a curated weekly list of episodes with the episode premiere times.
